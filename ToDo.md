# Notes
1. Testing
   * Test Your system after each session
   * Agile-->After finishing part see it's solution
2. Keeping changes
   * Always commit with good messages
3. For not getting confused
   * Implement simple features first
   * Think on paper not on pc
   * Think what's purpose of this function
   * keep working small, so that you don't get mad
   * "ولو انكم تتوكلون علي الله حق توكله لرزقكم كما يرزق الطير تغدو خماصا و تروح بطانا"
